These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of this website and any
purchase or use of our digital products, downloads, and related services (collectively, the
“Service”). The Service is operated by Raylodies (“Raylodies”, “we”, “us”, “our”).
By accessing the site and/or purchasing any product, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
agree, do not use the Service.
1. GENERAL CONDITIONS
1.1 Eligibility. You must be able to form a legally binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the
Service. If you use the Service on behalf of an organisation, you confirm you have authority to
bind that organisation.
1.2 Right to Refuse Service. To the extent permitted by law, we may refuse service, restrict
access, or cancel orders in cases of suspected fraud, misuse, policy violations, or abuse.
1.3 Changes. We may update products, pricing, and site content at any time. Continued use of
the Service means you accept any posted updates.
2. MERCHANT OF RECORD & PAYMENTS
2.1 Merchant of Record. Our checkout is handled by Paddle.com (“Paddle”), which acts as the
Merchant of Record for purchases made through this website. Paddle processes payments and
handles applicable tax collection where required.
2.2 Paddle Terms. By purchasing, you acknowledge you are purchasing from Paddle and you
agree to Paddle’s applicable buyer terms and policies, in addition to these Terms.
2.3 Billing Support. Payment, invoice, tax, and charge dispute support may be handled by
Paddle. For product usage or access issues, you may contact us at the support email above.
3. DIGITAL PRODUCTS, DELIVERY & ACCESS
3.1 Digital Products. Our products are digital goods (e.g., prompts, digital prints, mockups,
blueprints, templates, and similar downloadable assets) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
3.2 Delivery. Products are typically delivered via download link or access instructions
immediately after successful payment, or shortly thereafter.
3.3 Your Responsibility. You are responsible for ensuring your email address is correct and that
your device/software can open the files. We are not responsible for issues caused by unsupported
software, outdated versions, or user error.
4. PRODUCT INFORMATION & AVAILABILITY
We aim to display products accurately. However, previews are illustrative and may vary by
device, software, or AI model behaviour (where relevant). We do not guarantee that product
descriptions, previews, or any site content are error-free.
5. MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTS & PRICES
Prices and product contents may change at any time. We may modify or discontinue products
without notice. Where required by law, changes will not affect orders already completed.
6. LICENSING TERMS
These licensing terms explain what you may and may not do with what you purchase.
6.1 Definitions
•
•
•
“Digital Products” means any digital item sold on the site, including prompts, prompt
packs, digital prints, mockups, blueprints, templates, design assets, files, guides, or
downloads.
“Licensed Content” means the Digital Products you purchase (including any included
files, text, layouts, and documentation).
“End Product” means a finished outcome you create using the Licensed Content (e.g., a
brand design, marketing creative, social post, video, website mock, rendered image,
client presentation, or generated AI output).
6.2 Licence Grant
Subject to your compliance with these Terms and full payment, Raylodies grants you a limited,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Licensed
Content in accordance with these Terms.
Unless your product page states otherwise, your purchase includes a Standard Licence (Section
6.3–6.7).
6.3 Standard Licence — Allowed Uses
Under the Standard Licence, you may:
• Use the Licensed Content for personal use and commercial projects.
• Modify or adapt Licensed Content to create End Products, as long as you do not
distribute the Licensed Content itself as a standalone file.
• Use Licensed Content in client work, provided the client receives only the End Product
(e.g., exported visuals, flattened files, rendered outputs) and not the original files or
packs, unless the client purchases their own licence.
• Use mockups/blueprints for presentations, demonstrations, design exploration, and
commercial visuals, subject to the restrictions below.
6.4 Prompts & Prompt Packs — Special Rules
If you purchase prompts or prompt packs, you may:
• Use prompts to generate outputs for personal or commercial use.
• Edit prompts for your own workflow.
You may not:
• Share, publish, resell, redistribute, or leak the prompts (or any substantial portion of
them), including in “prompt libraries”, public posts, Discord/Telegram groups, courses,
or marketplaces, unless you have written permission from Raylodies.
• Sell prompts as standalone prompt products or bundles that compete with the Licensed
Content.
AI Output Note: AI-generated outputs can vary depending on model updates, settings, seed, and
platform rules. We do not guarantee specific results.
6.5 Digital Prints — Special Rules
Unless the product page states otherwise, you may:
• Download and use digital prints for personal display and personal printing.
• Use them inside End Products (e.g., as part of a design composition, campaign mock,
editorial layout, or brand concept) where the print is not being redistributed as a
standalone file.
You may not under the Standard Licence:
• Sell, license, or distribute the digital print as a standalone artwork file.
• Sell the print on merchandise, print-on-demand, art marketplaces, or physical print sales
as the main product (unless you have an Extended/Resale Licence from Raylodies, if
offered).
6.6 Mockups, Templates & Assets — Special Rules
You may use mockups/templates/assets to present or market your work or your client’s work, but
you may not:
• Resell or redistribute mockups/templates/assets as standalone items (original or
modified), including as “mockup packs”, “template bundles”, “brand kits”, or “asset
libraries”.
• Give away the source files to clients, teams, or third parties unless they have their own
licence.
6.7 Blueprints / Guides / Concept Files — Disclaimer + Limits
Blueprints or guides may be creative, conceptual, or educational. They are not professional
engineering, architectural, medical, or legal advice. You are responsible for ensuring compliance
with safety standards, regulations, and real-world suitability before using any blueprint in
practical implementation.
6.8 Prohibited Uses (All Products)
You may not:
• Resell, redistribute, share, gift, upload, or make available the Licensed Content
(original or modified) as standalone files, including via cloud folders, file-sharing sites,
Telegram groups, torrents, marketplaces, or “free downloads”.
• Create or sell competing packs/libraries where the primary value is the Licensed Content.
• Remove or obscure proprietary notices (if present).
• Claim ownership of the Licensed Content itself, register it as a trademark/copyright, or
misrepresent authorship.
• Use the Licensed Content in unlawful, infringing, or misleading ways.
6.9 Seat / Team Use
Unless the product page states otherwise, purchases are for single-user use. If a
team/studio/organisation will access the files, you must purchase a multi-seat option (if
available) or obtain written permission.
6.10 AI / Model Training Restriction
Unless explicitly permitted in writing by Raylodies, you may not use the Licensed Content to
train, fine-tune, or improve any AI/ML model or to build datasets for training (including
scraping, dataset packaging, or bulk ingestion).
6.11 Ownership & Reservation of Rights
Raylodies (and/or its licensors) retains all rights, title, and interest in the Licensed Content. You
receive a licence to use it — not ownership.
6.12 Product-Specific Terms
If a product page or included file specifies additional licence terms, those terms apply to that
product. If there is a conflict, the product-specific terms control.
7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
All site content and Licensed Content are owned by Raylodies or its licensors and protected by
applicable intellectual property laws. Except for the licence granted above, no rights are granted.
8. USER CONDUCT
You agree not to misuse the Service, including attempting to:
• bypass payment mechanisms,
• access systems without authorisation,
• upload malware,
• use the Service for fraud or abusive behaviour,
• violate third-party rights or applicable laws.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Raylodies (including its employees, contractors,
affiliates, licensors, and service providers) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill arising from
your use of the Service or Digital Products.
Where liability cannot be excluded, it is limited to the amount you paid for the specific product
giving rise to the claim (or the minimum required by law, if higher).
11. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Raylodies and its affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, and agents from claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Service.
12. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States of America, without regard to
conflict of law principles, except that payment disputes may be handled through Paddle’s
processes as Merchant of Record.
13. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted with a new Effective
Date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
14. SEVERABILITY & ENTIRE AGREEMENT
If any part of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. These Terms
and the policies referenced form the entire agreement regarding the Service.
