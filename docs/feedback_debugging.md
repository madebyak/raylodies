This is a feedback about some things that we want to change / imrpove
each point you should consider deeply and think of it line by line without jumping into conclusions, alwways consider our styling , colors , style of UI and coding we have 



1. in the navbar we want to remove the time of UAE , no need to this anywhere 
2. in the footer , add powered by MoonWhale (hyperlink: www.moonswhale.com)
3.update the social icons / links everywhere in the website in all pages compoennts to the following:
https://x.com/rno_jay
www.linkedin.com/in/ranya-hamawandy-2bb4011b3
https://www.instagram.com/raylodies/

4.in start project page > headline 
remove word "together"

5. in start project page > remove location compeltly 
6.in the about page , the headline : let's crate something WOW
change the "Wow" font to google font: Ms Madi (install it and integrate it)
and make it animated loop gradeint vibrant purple and pink (only the word "Wow")

7. in the about > skills 
remove motion design 

and in tools and technolgoies 
remove photoshop and dali 
add : Kling Ai , Veo3 , Higgsfield 

8. in the homepage > selected work section 
change the subheading / description to this text:
Directed visual narratives spanning commercial projects and experimental concepts.

9. in the work > below the headline "work" there's subheading / descritpion , change the description text to :
A collection of projects exploring the boundaries of digital creativity and artificial intelligence. A look into how I translate raw data into specific, curated visions.

10. in the backend admin > product page > upload digital file 
it's allowing us to upload only zip file, we need to allow it to upload zip, rar, pdf, jpeg, png , videos 
basically allow it to upload anything

11. for the store > products 
we need to add tags (keywords), this needs to be integrated in the databse if it's not established yet, then implement it in the upload product in the admin and configure / integarte 

after that we need to add search bar in the store page that search on products based on title , or keywords 


12. i want you to think about this issue deeply and creativly, we have issue for the work (work page and also homepage)
most of my work that i create and publish on my social media which i publish the same on the website are videos 9:16 (reel size), sometimes i have 16:9 and sometimes i have 3:4 
but the majority is 9:16 
can we create a dynamic gird that reads and distrubte contents based on their size instead of cropping them to the exisitng fixed size? considering the grid to look super beautiful (maybe something smilar to pinterest)

i don't want you to do any changes in the code yet, i want you to analyze run your web research and find best practise / approach for this in terms of creative look and feel , responsivmness on small screens like mobile and tablet. as well as functional and easy for the admin so the admin doesn't need to re-size the work we do everytime.


13. can you investigate in the backend for work and products and tell me if writing the slug for each published work / product is logical? i think this should be generated automatically and ensure it's SEO super friendly no? what do you think?
